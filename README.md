### 👤 User Interface Features
- **Login/Signup** interface (UI only - no backend authentication)
- **Context-based State Management** for cart and user data persistence during session
- **Interactive Product Selection** with size options and quantity controls
- **Local Storage** simulation for cart persistence (session-based)

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React 18** - Modern React with hooks and functional components for building interactive UIs
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool and development server for optimal development experience
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Modern JavaScript features including arrow functions, destructuring, and modules
- **CSS3** - Custom styling with responsive design and smooth animations
- **Context API** - React's built-in state management for handling cart and user interface state
- **React Router** - Client-side routing for smooth single-page application navigation
- **Static Data** - Product information stored in JavaScript files for easy management

> **Note**: This is a frontend-only application. All data is stored locally in JavaScript files, and cart state is managed through React Context API for the current session.

## 💡 Key Components Explained

### Frontend Architecture
This application demonstrates a component-based architecture that's fundamental to React development. Each piece of the user interface is broken down into reusable components, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand. The structure follows React best practices with clear separation of concerns between presentation and logic.

### Context Management for State
The application uses React Context API as its primary state management solution, which is perfect for a frontend-only application. The `ShopContext.jsx` file centralizes all shopping cart operations and user interface state, allowing any component throughout the app to access and modify cart data without the complexity of prop drilling. This simulates how a real ecommerce app would manage user sessions and cart persistence.

### Client-Side Routing
The routing system creates a smooth single-page application experience where users can navigate between different sections (homepage, category pages, individual products, cart, and login) without full page reloads. This approach provides a modern web experience that feels fast and responsive.

### Static Data Management
Since this is a frontend-only application, all product data is stored in JavaScript files within the assets folder. This approach allows for easy product management and demonstrates how data structures work in React applications. In a real-world scenario, this data would come from a backend API, but the component structure remains the same.

### Responsive Design Philosophy
Every component is built with mobile-first principles, ensuring the application adapts beautifully to different screen sizes. This demonstrates modern CSS techniques and responsive design patterns that are essential for today's web applications.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives & Skills Demonstrated
